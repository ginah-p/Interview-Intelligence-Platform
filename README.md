# Interview Intelligence Platform 📊

A **data engineering and analytics project** that transforms interview preparation data into actionable insights through a well-designed data warehouse and ETL pipeline.

> **Built during placement season to solve a real problem: analyzing interview patterns, identifying weak topics, and making data-driven preparation decisions.**

## 🎯 Project Overview

This isn't just another CRUD app - it's a complete **data warehouse solution** that demonstrates:
- ✅ Star schema design and dimensional modeling
- ✅ ETL pipeline development
- ✅ Complex analytical queries
- ✅ Performance optimization techniques
- ✅ Data quality management

**Perfect for Data Engineering / Analytics roles!**

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Data Sources → ETL Pipeline → Data Warehouse (Star Schema) → Analytics Layer → Dashboard
```

### Star Schema Design
```
          dim_companies
                ↓
dim_time → fact_interview_events ← dim_round_types
                ↓
          dim_questions
                ↓
          dim_topics (hierarchical)
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema Details

### Fact Table: `fact_interview_events`
**Grain**: One row per question asked in an interview round

**Key Measures**:
- Duration, difficulty rating, answer quality
- Result (passed/failed/pending)
- Preparation indicators (was_prepared, needed_hint)

### Dimension Tables

**dim_companies**: Company profiles with industry classification
**dim_time**: Date dimension (2024-2025) for time-based analysis
**dim_topics**: 3-level hierarchy (Category → Subcategory → Concept)
**dim_questions**: Question bank with SCD Type 2 for history tracking
**dim_round_types**: Interview round categorization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Database & Modeling:**
- PostgreSQL (Relational database)
- Star schema dimensional modeling
- Indexing and query optimization

**Backend & ETL:**
- Python 3.x
- psycopg2 (PostgreSQL adapter)
- Pandas (Data transformation)
- SQLAlchemy (ORM - planned)

**Analytics:**
- SQL (Complex joins, window functions, CTEs)
- Analytical views and materialized views
- Aggregations and time-series analysis

**Future Additions:**
- dbt (Data Build Tool) for transformations
- Apache Airflow for orchestration
- Plotly Dash / Streamlit for dashboards
- Great Expectations for data quality

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.8+
PostgreSQL 12+
pip
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interview-analytics-platform.git
cd interview-analytics-platform
```

2. **Set up PostgreSQL database**
```bash
createdb interview_analytics
```

3. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Initialize data warehouse**
```bash
psql -d interview_analytics -f schema/star_schema.sql
```

6. **Populate with seed data**
```bash
python scripts/seed_data.py
```

7. **Test with sample queries**
```bash
psql -d interview_analytics -f queries/sample_analytics.sql
```

## 📊 Sample Analytics Queries

This project includes 12+ analytical queries demonstrating:

1. **Aggregations**: Most frequently asked topics
2. **Joins**: Multi-table analysis across dimensions
3. **Window Functions**: Rolling 7-day performance trends
4. **Hierarchical Queries**: Topic hierarchy analysis
5. **Time-Series**: Monthly performance trends
6. **Correlation Analysis**: Preparation impact on success
7. **Ranking & Filtering**: Top weak topics needing focus
8. **Complex CTEs**: Multi-step analytical computations

**Example Query** (Topic Frequency Analysis):
```sql
SELECT 
    t.topic_name,
    COUNT(f.event_key) as times_asked,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN f.result = 'passed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate
FROM fact_interview_events f
JOIN dim_questions q ON f.question_key = q.question_key
JOIN dim_topics t ON q.topic_key = t.topic_key
GROUP BY t.topic_name
ORDER BY times_asked DESC;
```
