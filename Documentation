* strftime:

* psycopg2:

* cursor.execute method:"This code populates the dim_time table with every single date from 2024-01-01 to 2025-12-31, along with pre-calculated date attributes.Why? So you never have to calculate "what quarter is this date in?" or "is this a weekend?" during queries - it's already stored!"

* Conflict clause: If we try to insert a date that already exists (same full_date)
Don't throw an error
Just skip it and move on

Why needed?

You might run the seed script multiple times
Prevents duplicate dates

* Greedy Algorithms are a problem-solving approach where you make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping it leads to a globally optimal solution.Key Concept:

Make the best choice RIGHT NOW
Never reconsider previous choices
Hope it works out overall!
Real-Life Example:
Imagine you're making change for $0.63 using US coins:

Greedy approach: Always pick the largest coin possible
